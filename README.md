FAQs

Q1) How to use the .ahk file?

For launching the code install AutoHotKey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)  then open the .ahk file once you are near the Palace Approch Ledge-Road site of grace. Press F3.

Q2) How do I get to farming location?

In order to get to the farming location, you have to gain access to Mohgwyn Palace by progressing through White Mask Varré questline until you get Pureblood Knight's Medal. (Full Walkthrough Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNOYu6jCIUE). When you got into Mohgwyn Palace ride Torrent through Albinaurics once you got to the lake head straight to the left and climb the cliff until you see the Palace Approch Ledge-Road site of grace. Rest there and run the .ahk file.

Q3) What is the sword that I have to use?

Sacred Relic Sword (https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Sacred+Relic+Sword) which you need to beat the game and got the Elden Remembrance to get it. Trade Elden Remembrance with Enia at Roundtable Hold.

Note: From settings -> Key Bindings change your mouse movement left to (J) and skill to (N)

Q4) Can I modify this macro?

Sure, click to Edit File and use it for your own purposes farming runes, going somewhere basically repeating same actions.

The macro is not working properly?

The macro cannot understand when will your loading screen pass. That is why I tried to make the Sleep timeline for 4.6 seconds. If your pc are slower you may try to modify the sleep time.

Q5) Why didn't you add the bird into the macro?

According to the calculations of u/SpecialistRelief9886; It is not worth it to add bird in  terms of time: 

Each set of aliens nets you 13 * 6.6k / 15 seconds = 5.72k runes / second. Each second is worth 5.72k runes if you farm aliens alone.

For the bird to be at least as efficient, it has to take no more than 31k / 5.72k seconds = 5.4 extra seconds. You need to kill the bird 100% of the time in under 5 seconds added just to break even. Faster than 5 seconds isn’t likely even with a perfect bot.

Spending 2 seconds to cast Rock Sling costs you 11.44k runes. So it has to be successful at least 36% of the time (with at most 2 seconds spent).

Still if you want to add the bird you can edit and add it to the macro for yourself.

Q6) What is the point of farming runes?

If this is your first playthrough I would advise you to play as it meant to be. Even if you suffer and search for an easy mode. There is no need to be rush, believe me after all that suffering beating the game feels incredible. If you want to try another account and level up fast without suffering or when you are in NG+ and try out some new builds, this macro can be life saver for you.

Q7) Why not just, like, use a trainer or save editor to give yourself many runes as you want?

There is a probability of getting banned from online gameplay. Even though macros are considered as cheating as well the chance of getting banned due to use of macro is significantly less than just straight up using hack client to give you runes. Furthermore, I would highly suggest you to use these macro for only single-player.
